                    <h3>Australia’s best wine regions</h3>
                    <p>Charming landscapes, exquisite food, and world-class wines. It all comes together at wineries
                        across Australia.
                        Australian wine ranks among the world’s best. Whether you like to sit and sip among the vines or
                        dive deep into the
                        winemaking world, there’s a cellar door in Australia to suit. Unwind with a glass of red in the
                        Barossa Valley or
                        wander through the vines in the Adelaide Hills. Whatever your style, start with these top
                        wineries located across
                        the country. </p>

                    <h3>Wineries near Adelaide</h3>
                    <h4>Barossa Valley</h4>
                    <p>South Australia is home to some of the oldest continuously producing vineyards in the world, so
                        it’s no surprise that
                        its regions are regarded as some of the country’s best. In the Barossa Valley, you’ll find the
                        region’s claim to
                        fame - big, bold shiraz that’s exceptionally smooth. Seppeltsfield, one of the most historic
                        wineries in the
                        Barossa, is the only winery in the world to release a 100-year-old vintage wine every year. They
                        also offer unique
                        experiences, including the opportunity to taste wine made in the year you were born straight
                        from the barrel.

                    <h4>Adelaide Hills</h4>
                    <p>The Adelaide Hills, less than an hour from the city, has a cool climate and an elevated altitude
                        that makes wines
                        distinct from others produced in the state. Expect complex, medium-weight wines at wineries like
                        Ashton Hills,
                        renowned for its pinot noir, and Shaw + Smith, a large cellar door offering up standard and

                        Block label, and Hardys Tintara, boasting a legacy of over 160 years. One of the most unique
                        winery experiences in
                        Australia is an architectural anomaly set within the vines of the picturesque landscape of
                        McLaren Vale. d’Arenberg
                        winery is a top spot for wine tasting, but its hero is the d’Arenberg Cube, an impressive
                        five-storey structure
                        fashioned after an unfinished Rubik’s Cube. Stay for lunch to dine on convention-breaking dishes
                        and gaze out at the
                        surrounding vineyards. </p>
